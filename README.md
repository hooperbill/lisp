In 1984 I became interested in LISP and the only place you could find LISP was on large computers typically in a university environment. I wrote this version of LISP for the CP/M operating system as a personal exercise. I recently found a copy of the source code and posted it here. Because of significant changes in the C language between 1984 and now the code compiles, but with a lot of warnings. Use the CMAKE command to create build environment and then build the executable. Included are some simple LISP programs.

I am not going to necessarily support this code, but just make it available for anyone who would like to view the code, point, and laugh, or provide some insight on how to improve the program.

Many thanks and have fun!
